    **w**eb-**u**tilized **r**eact **s**ynthesizer **t**est
  long_desc: |
    Just stumbled over the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
    Actually i wanted to see if it's possible to program an efficient synthesizer in javascript.
    As it turns out, this API provides an interface that is exactly for building synthesizers...

    So then i wanted to see if [React](https://reactjs.org/) can be used to drive the event-loop
    of the step-sequencers. Did not want to use [redux](https://redux.js.org/) this time and learned about
    [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) and especially
    [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and all these magic
    functions.

    As to be expected, the timing of `setTimeout` driving the react dispatchers is not good
    enough to drive an audio machine correctly (where 20 milliseconds off are already
    perceived as *not in the beat*). It's fun though!

  short_desc: |
    Scraper for (german) free dates at the public offices
  long_desc: |
    This is recording hundrets of public office calendars across germany at an interval of
    15 minutes.

    It's much more work than i anticipated in the first place and i'm still not sure
    exactly for what purpose.

clipig:
  categories: visual
  short_desc: |
    [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)
    based image generator with complex config file controlled transformation and training pipelines
  long_desc: |
    *The web* has become quite an amazing place: Train a model on some of it's data. Ask for a depiction
    of your favorite fantasy book. [And it just does](https://defgsus.github.io/blog/2021/04/28/malazan-clip-features.html)!

    This is a somewhat usable tool for generating images using the CLIP critique. Check the
    [walkthrough](https://defgsus.github.io/clipig/walkthrough.html)
    and [some experimental results](https://defgsus.github.io/blog/2021/06/09/clipig-animal-transfer.html).

image-scraper:
  categories: visual ai
  short_desc: |

  long_desc: |
    Actually, this is just a small dev tool to download images (porn images mainly),
    rate them via [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and search through them using
    natural language and reference images.

    as the basis for static site generation.

    **Überwachung für Alle** - self-surveillance browser add-on
  long_desc: |
    Spy on your own browser actions (request, keystrokes, mouse actions) using this
    small web extension and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

    Learned about the (somewhat unified) Browser Extensions API
    ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/))
    which is so powerful that i **do not trust any extension** except my own ones.
    Oh, and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), of course.

elastipy:
  categories: lib
  short_desc: |
    python elasticsearch query module for easily accessing nested aggregations and such
  long_desc: |
    This is a library for [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) queries. They
    provide [their own](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-dsl-py) library for that
    but it does not help with either generating the right query or accessing the results in
    a sane manner. Elastipy has a fully typed interface and tries to be smart with aggregation
    responses, converting them into simplified `dict`s or
    [pandas DataFrames](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.html).

    Learned: Generating documentation and examples from jupyter notebooks. And that the whole
    documentation system in python is good only on the surface.
    Actually it's painful, not well documented and time consuming.
    No surprise, why all the major libs have their own documentation infrastructure
    (hacked [Sphinxes](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/)).

symmetrical-disco:
  categories: visual
  short_desc: |
    ray-tracer entirely in python
  long_desc: |
    Thought: If i write the raytracer (in this case a sphere-tracer) in python, there are
    endless pythonian things i could do on top to create amazing images.

    Learned: Writing a raytracer in C or Cuda instead of python is **not** premature optimization.
    The python raytracer is so terribly slow that i actually did not fix the immediate bugs and just stopped.

cthulhu2d:

  short_desc: |
    toying with another game idea and the pymunk physics framework
  long_desc: |
    Tried: A 2d minecraft.

    Learned: That in order to pass objects, you have to completely destroy them or build a tunnel or somehting..

    This came out of a deep depression through covid winter 2020 with too much home schooling and home officing
    and no place to hide. In the end i did not came across the challange of designing a physical-model-based
    character that actually can walk. Tried evolutionary algos with complicated fitness evaluation and
    training pools stored in [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

pypickpack:
  categories: game
  short_desc: |
    In an amazon fulfillment center near you the job application turns out to be
    against a bunch of newly designed super-efficient robots!
  long_desc: |
    Started reworking the [pickpack](#pickpack) idea into python to experiment
    with [Maximum Expected Utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_utility_hypothesis) described by
    [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russel & Norvig)](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/).
    But it's still missing a straight game design.

    Basically, you are picking and packing in an amazon fulfillment center against a bunch of
    super-efficient robots. The idea is, that the robots would actually need to cheat
    (stay in your way, put wrong stuff into your parcels, ..) if you are really good.
    Of course, if the ever-present fulfillment center's performance measures are too low,
    the manager should come complaining.

    Learned: In python you won't get millions of search branches checked per second so you
    have to rely more on heuristics and cheats.

trends-competition:
  categories: ai
  short_desc: |
    Yet another [TReNDS Neuroimaging competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/trends-assessment-prediction) sourcecode
  long_desc: |
    It was hosted on kaggle and **a lot** of teams joined. I only used **relevance vector regression** on
    the small MRT-based CSV tables which bought an evaluation error of 16.4% and place 891.
    The top solutions where 15.6%.

    Learned: That this particular problem in the competition was not helped by mere compute. The best teams used
    all kinds of complicated things and ensembled them together to gain just one percent better than a simple RVR
    on a fraction of the data.

shadertoz:
  categories: visual data shader
  short_desc: |
    momentarily a django using the shadertoy public api
  long_desc: |
    Another personal plaything related to [shadertoy.com](https://shadertoy.com). Besids the official API
    it also allows crawling the shadertoy website / internal API to retrieve comments.

    One of the goals is to be able to somehow search for specific formulas / syntax trees, by parsing
    all the GLSL in python. The parser somewhat works by adjusting an old
    [Backus-Naur for C--](https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~debray/Teaching/CSc453/DOCS/cminusminusspec.html) that i found
    and adding the few GLSL specific things ([glsl.lark](https://github.com/defgsus/shadertoz/blob/b89c15db6dd4821126a3e970a57eadcb97f529d5/shaders/util/glsl/glsl.lark))
    and run it in [lark](https://github.com/lark-parser/lark). But it exponentially explodes in runtime when shown
    long and complicated formulas.

    It could display tickets from [YouTrack](https://www.jetbrains.com/youtrack/). And it would
    engage in a german [Eliza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA) therapy chat.

    The rendering is particularily nice, optically. It uses *sphere tracing* through a pre-generated

    Also started an editor in [PyQt](https://github.com/pyqt/). Learned: Programming Qt in python
    is almost fun, compared to C++.

  long_desc: |
    A project with [Francis Monkman](http://afkm.com/). Through friends in Russia he got into
    contact with this game called Shatra. It's the mongolian version of a checkers-like game.
    Some russian suggested to use chess figures which makes it a kind of turbo-checker-chess.

    It's a cool game and Francis has been working for decades on efficient
    [alpha-beta pruning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning) for this
    particular rule set.

    We forked [ChessX](https://chessx.sourceforge.io/) which is a Qt/C++ project, mainly
    for archiving and studying chess games, and extended it to both Shatra versions and
    added a play mode.
