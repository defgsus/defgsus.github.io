    **w**eb-**u**tilized **r**eact **s**ynthesizer **t**est
  long_desc: |
    Just stumbled over the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API).
    Actually i wanted to see if it's possible to program an efficient synthesizer in javascript.
    As it turns out, this API provides an interface that is exactly for building synthesizers...

    So then i wanted to see if [React](https://reactjs.org/) can be used to drive the event-loop
    of the step-sequencers. Did not want to use [redux](https://redux.js.org/) this time and learned about
    [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html) and especially
    [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) and all these magic
    functions.

office-schedule-scraper:
  short_desc: |
    Scraper for (german) free dates at the public offices
  long_desc: |
    This is recording hundrets of public office calendars across germany at an interval of
    15 minutes.

    It's much more work than i anticipated in the first place and i'm still not sure
    exactly why i do it.

clipig:
  short_desc: |
    [OpenAI](https://openai.com)'s [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP)
    based image generator with complex config file controlled transformation and training pipelines
  long_desc: |
    *The web* has become quite an amazing place: Train a model on some of it's data. Ask for a depiction
    of your favorite fantasy book. [And it just does](https://defgsus.github.io/blog/2021/04/28/malazan-clip-features.html)!

    This is a somewhat usable tool for generating images using the CLIP critique. Check the
    [walkthrough](https://defgsus.github.io/clipig/walkthrough.html)
    and [some experimental results](https://defgsus.github.io/blog/2021/06/09/clipig-animal-transfer.html).

image-scraper:
  short_desc: |

  long_desc: |
    Actually, this is just a small dev tool to download images (porn images mainly),
    rate them via [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP) and search through them using
    natural language and reference images.

    as the basis for static site generation.

    **Überwachung für Alle** - self-surveillance browser add-on
  long_desc: |
    Spy on your own browser actions (request, keystrokes, mouse actions) using this
    small web extension and [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/).

    Learned about the (somewhat unified) Browser Extensions API
    ([MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions), [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/))
    which is so powerful that i **do not trust any extension** except my own ones.
    Oh, and [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), of course.

symmetrical-disco:
  short_desc: |
    ray-tracer entirely in python
  long_desc: |
    Thought: If i write the raytracer (in this case a sphere-tracer) in python, there are
    endless pythonian things i could do on top to create amazing images.

    Learned: Writing a raytracer in C or Cuda instead of python is **not** premature optimization.
    The python raytracer is so terribly slow that i actually did not fix the immediate bugs and just stopped.
